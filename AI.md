Increments Assisted by AI:
A-Refactor (SLAP/Command Pattern): Abstracted the monolithic switch-case in SaitamaSensei.java into a Parser and multiple Command classes to adhere to the < 30 lines per method rule.

A-BetterGui: Implemented asymmetric dialog styling (different colors for User/Saitama) and added a PauseTransition to simulate a "thinking" delay for the bot.
